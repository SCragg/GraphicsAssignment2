# GraphicsAssignment2
Second assignment for my graphics module. A scene of grass terrain with firefly particles moving around. 

Created using OpenGL in C++. Code left as it was when submitted, with all errors still unchanged.

There is mistake in the calculation of the normals of the under lying terrain which is easy to correct.

Program is not well optimised improvement can be made to speed up the program. Perhaps using pregenerated textures to control length and bend and colour of pseudorandom numbers to vastly reduce number of calculations in the geometry shader.
